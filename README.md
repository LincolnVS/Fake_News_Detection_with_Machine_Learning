# [Course] Fake News Detection with Machine Learning

Instructor: Ryan Ahmed

### Course Objectives
  In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

  - Apply python libraries to import and visualize datasets
  - Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
  - Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
  - Understand the concept of tokenizer.
  - Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model.
  - Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
  - Build and train the deep learning model
  - Access the performance of the trained model

### Project Structure
  The hands on project on NLP : Fake News Detector is divided into following tasks:

  - Task #1: Understand the Problem Statement and business case
  - Task #2: Import libraries and datasets
  - Task #3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Task #4: Perform Data Cleaning
  - Task #5: Visualize the cleaned data
  - Task #6: Prepare the data by tokenizing and padding
  - Task #7: Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
  - Task #8: Build and train the model
  - Task #9: Assess trained model performance


  > This course runs on Coursera's hands-on platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops that have all the software and data you will need. So, you can just focus on the learning. For this project, this means instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and TensorFlow pre-installed.
